            <h2>Understanding the May 2024 Solar Storms</h2>
            <p>In May 2024, the Sun was highly active, producing multiple large solar flares that impacted Earth in various ways. These solar storms created stunning auroras, disrupted satellite communications, and increased radiation levels in space.</p>
            <p>NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory captured these incredible solar events, providing crucial data to understand the science behind solar flares and their interaction with Earth's magnetic field.</p>
            <p><strong>What Happened:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple large solar flares occurred, causing geomagnetic storms on Earth.</li>
                <li>Auroras were visible much farther from the poles than usual, with breathtaking displays of light.</li>
                <li>Satellite-based services like GPS and communications were disrupted.</li>
                <li>Increased radiation levels posed risks to astronauts and high-altitude flights.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our challenge is to use NASA data to create a visual representation that helps the public better understand these solar storms and their impact on Earth and technology.</p>
            <p>Join us in this exploration of solar activity and its effects on our planet!</p>
